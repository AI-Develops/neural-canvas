**Neural Canvas** is an interactive visualization platform designed to help developers, students, and AI enthusiasts explore and understand neural network architectures. Built with pure vanilla JavaScript and modern CSS, it runs entirely in the browser with zero dependencies.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Neural Canvas transforms complex neural network architectures into beautiful, interactive visualizations. Whether you're learning about deep learning or debugging your models, Neural Canvas provides an intuitive interface to understand how data flows through networks.

## ✨ Features

- **🧠 Interactive Network Builder**: Drag and drop to create custom neural network architectures
- **📊 Real-Time Visualization**: Watch data propagate through your network in real-time
- **🎨 Modern UI**: Beautiful dark-mode interface with glassmorphism effects
- **📱 Fully Responsive**: Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **⚡ Zero Dependencies**: Built with vanilla JavaScript - no frameworks required
- **♿ Accessible**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant with full keyboard navigation
- **🚀 Lightweight**: Under 100KB total - loads instantly

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

Neural Canvas embraces a **high-tech, dark-mode aesthetic** with:
- Custom CSS variables for consistent theming
- Glassmorphism effects for depth and hierarchy
- Smooth animations and transitions
- Responsive grid system
- Accessible color contrasts (WCAG AA compliant)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with ARIA attributes
- **CSS3**: Custom Properties, Grid, Flexbox, Animations
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**: Canvas API, Event Delegation, Modules
- **SVG**: Inline icons from Heroicons
